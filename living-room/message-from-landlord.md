Welcome to your new home!

Hopefully you're getting settled in and adjusting to your new space.
There's one small thing I need you to take care of for me, if you don't mind.
It occurred to me that we never had you look at the lease.
Or sign it for that matter.
Only problem is the intern insisted we get "hip with it", and now all our leases are *digital*.

Each `term-world` property comes equipped with a robotic assistant, named `cliVe`.
He should be able to help you out with downloading the lease file.
But you'll still need to actually *print out* the lease so you can sign it.
Thankfully your `house` comes equipped with a few essential appliances, like a `printer`.
You're welcome.
